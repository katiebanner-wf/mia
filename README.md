__Description:__ Unnecessary filing extensions in the SEC implementation of XBRL introduce meaningless variability in extensions and make XBRL more difficult to use. It appears filers are creating many redundant extensions (up to 50% of all extensions). Conversely, SEC Staff have observed, and stated, "a significant number of extensions are reasonable and appropriate." 

__Specific aims:__

- Look at rates of XBRL filing extensions over time.
- Provide framework for identifying unnecessary extensions, analyze a sample of filings and compare to earlier research findings regarding the rate of unnecessary extensions 
- Recommend actions to reduce the rate of unnecessary filing extensions. 
- Incorporate new data (2014 - 2016) into initial analysis. 

__Initial analyses:__ 

- Analysis of 2012 - 2014 data was done by Lauren Evans
- Original work is available [in this google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwd8O9XpwVpifmZMSWlTNzVNMno0SVhnYUJnT1JzbXFvQ0luOTlqdmtJTDBKOFNHUHhzRG8)
- A reorganized dropbox folder is located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8xJOcoF5xgYQUhtR2YxVUJUem8)
- A github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/katiebanner-wf/mia)

__Organization of the new drive folder:__

- Directories

    - `analyses-new` contains `ext-rate_explore.Rmd`, a file with all of the code chunks used in the original analyses and notes for me (Katie Banner). Compiling this file is easy, just hit `knit`. The code chunks will navigate to the `data` directory and read in the necessary .csv files. 
    - `data` conatins all of the .csv files in the orginal anlysis
    - `analyses-old` contains Lauren's original work
    - `code` contains a script file Michael Lerch wrote
    - `original-docs` contains .pdf documents `exten_wp4.pdf` (Lauren's final report) and `extension_rate_analysis.pdf` an earlier version of the final report.
