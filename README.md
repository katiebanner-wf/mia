__Description:__ Unnecessary filing extensions in the SEC implementation of XBRL introduce meaningless variability in extensions and make XBRL more difficult to use. It appears filers are creating many redundant extensions (up to 50% of all extensions). Conversely, SEC Staff have observed, and stated, “a significant number of extensions are reasonable and appropriate.” 

__Specific aims:__

- Look at rates of XBRL filing extensions over time.
- Provide framework for identifying unnecessary extensions, analyze a sample of filings and compare to earlier research findings regarding the rate of unnecessary extensions 
- Recommend actions to reduce the rate of unnecessary filing extensions.
